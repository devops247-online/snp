A **production-ready**, fast, and reliable pre-commit framework written in Rust. SNP is a high-performance replacement for [pre-commit](https://pre-commit.com/) with 100% configuration compatibility and comprehensive feature parity.

## ‚ö° Why SNP?

- **üî• Performance**: 3-5x faster than Python pre-commit with state-of-the-art optimizations
  - Advanced work-stealing task scheduler for optimal parallel execution
  - Multi-tier caching architecture (L1/L2/L3) with intelligent promotion/demotion
  - Lock-free data structures for improved concurrency performance
  - Bloom filter-based negative caching for performance optimization
  - Batch regex processing with compiled RegexSet optimization
  - Arena-based memory management for hot execution paths
  - Zero-copy string operations and incremental file change detection
- **üõ°Ô∏è Reliability**: Memory safety and comprehensive error handling through Rust
- **üîÑ Compatibility**: 100% compatible with existing `.pre-commit-config.yaml` files
- **üì¶ Easy Installation**: Single binary with no dependencies
- **üåç Cross-Platform**: Works on Linux, macOS, and Windows
- **‚úÖ Production Ready**: Comprehensive test suite with 758+ tests across 49 test files
- **üîó Language Support**: Comprehensive language plugins: Python, Rust, Node.js, Go, Ruby, System commands, and Docker
- **‚öôÔ∏è Advanced Features**: Hook chaining, dependency management, and API integration

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
# Install from crates.io
cargo install snp

# Or download from releases
curl -L https://github.com/devops247-online/snp/releases/latest/download/snp-linux-x86_64.tar.gz | tar xz
```

### Basic Usage

```bash
# Install git hooks with backup support
snp install

# Run hooks on staged files (full execution engine)
snp run

# Run hooks on all files with parallel processing
snp run --all-files

# Update hook versions with real GitHub/GitLab API
snp autoupdate

# Update specific repositories
snp autoupdate --repo https://github.com/psf/black

# Dry run to see what would be updated
snp autoupdate --dry-run

# Run with hook chaining and dependencies
snp run --show-deps
```

## üìã Configuration

SNP uses the same configuration format as pre-commit. Create a `.pre-commit-config.yaml` file:

```yaml
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/psf/black
    rev: 23.1.0
    hooks:
      - id: black
  - repo: https://github.com/pycqa/flake8
    rev: 6.0.0
    hooks:
      - id: flake8
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/mirrors-eslint
    rev: v8.57.0
    hooks:
      - id: eslint
        files: \.(js|ts|jsx|tsx)$
  - repo: https://github.com/golangci/golangci-lint
    rev: v1.54.2
    hooks:
      - id: golangci-lint
  - repo: https://github.com/rubocop/rubocop
    rev: v1.56.0
    hooks:
      - id: rubocop
```
